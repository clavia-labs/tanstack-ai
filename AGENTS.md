# AGENTS.md

Cross-agent guidance for this repository. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full project
overview, architecture, and conventions — this file mirrors the rules that
apply to every coding agent regardless of tool.

## Docs skill (mandatory for Claude, Grok, and Codex)

Before you plan, write, edit, or reorganize any file under `docs/`, you MUST
load the `docs` skill and follow it. This is not optional.

Use the Skill tool if this harness has one. If it does not, Read
`.claude/skills/docs/SKILL.md` (copies also live at
`.agents/skills/docs/SKILL.md` for Codex and `.grok/skills/docs/SKILL.md`
for Grok). Keep those three files identical.

Do not write docs from memory of this file. If you cannot load the skill,
stop. Tiny copy edits still load the skill; the skill decides which gates
to skip.

This also applies when planning a feature (include a doc-impact list) and
when finishing a behavior change (docs must update before the work is done).

## PR description skill (mandatory for Claude, Grok, and Codex)

Before `gh pr create`, and after an agent `git push` on a branch that already
has an open PR, you MUST load the `pr-description` skill and follow it.
This is not optional.

Use the Skill tool if this harness has one. If it does not, Read
`.claude/skills/pr-description/SKILL.md` (copies also live at
`.agents/skills/pr-description/SKILL.md` for Codex and
`.grok/skills/pr-description/SKILL.md` for Grok). Keep those three files
identical.

Do not invent a title and body from memory. If you cannot load the skill,
stop. A human-only `git push` in another terminal does not trigger this.

## Contributing guide (mandatory for issues and PRs)

Before you open a GitHub issue or pull request, you MUST read
`CONTRIBUTING.md` and follow it. This is not optional.

For issues: use the templates it points to. Include a minimal repro when
you report a bug.

For pull requests: fill the PR template honestly. Update `docs/` when the
change is user-facing. Include a changeset on the PR when a published
package changed. Do not open the PR and add those later.

If you cannot read `CONTRIBUTING.md`, stop.

## Ponytail skill (mandatory for Claude, Grok, and Codex)

Before you plan, write, or edit application code, tests, or examples, you
MUST load the `ponytail` skill and follow it. This is not optional.

Use the Skill tool if this harness has one. If it does not, Read
`.claude/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` (copies also live at
`.agents/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` for Codex and
`.grok/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` for Grok). Keep those three files
identical.

Do not design or implement from memory of this file. If you cannot load the
skill, stop.

Ponytail does not skip this repo's quality gates, E2E tests, or the `docs`
and `pr-description` skills. Load those when their own rules say so.

## Dependency Install

Run `pnpm install` before starting any task and again after every merge with
`main`.

## Adding a New Library

When you add a new library under `packages/`, add a `workspace:*` override for
it in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` under `overrides:` (e.g.
`'@tanstack/ai-foo': workspace:*`) and run `pnpm install`. Every `packages/`
library must have an entry — this forces any transitive or example dependency
that references a published version onto the local workspace copy. Use
`workspace:*` for internal deps in `package.json` as usual.

## Pre-PR Quality Gate (MANDATORY)

**Before committing, run the narrowest meaningful quality checks for your
changes and confirm they pass locally. Before opening a PR or pushing changes
intended for review, run the same checks CI runs.** If you make post-commit
changes, rebase, or merge before pushing to a PR, rerun the relevant checks
first.

Use the repo-preferred package manager, scripts, and Nx targets where
applicable. Do **not** commit or push while quality checks are failing unless
the user explicitly instructs otherwise; report the exact failing command and
failure instead.

The single canonical command is:

```bash
pnpm test:pr
```

This runs the exact target set the `PR` workflow runs in CI
(`nx affected --targets=test:sherif,test:knip,test:docs,test:eslint,test:lib,test:types,test:build,build --exclude=examples/**,testing/**`).

If you can't run `test:pr` (e.g. it's too slow on your machine), at minimum run
each of these and confirm they're green before pushing:

- `pnpm test:sherif` — workspace consistency
- `pnpm test:knip` — unused dependencies
- `pnpm test:docs` — doc link verification
- `pnpm test:eslint` — lint
- `pnpm test:types` — typecheck
- `pnpm test:lib` — unit tests
- `pnpm test:build` — build artifact verification
- `pnpm build` — build all affected packages
- `pnpm --filter @tanstack/ai-e2e test:e2e` — E2E suite (mandatory for any
  behavior change; see `testing/e2e/README.md`)

Do **not** rely on CI as your first signal. Run locally, fix, then push.

## Documentation

Load the `docs` skill first (see **Docs skill** above). Then also obey
these TanStack-specific rules when editing docs under `docs/`:

- **No `as` type-assertion casts in code samples.** Examples must type-check
  without `as SomeType` — narrow `unknown` values with `typeof` / `in`
  checks, type guards, or Standard Schema validation instead. (`as const` is
  fine — it's a const assertion, not a type cast.)
- **Show both sides of the coin.** When a doc spans server and client,
  include snippets for both halves (server endpoint AND client consumption).
- **Use the latest model per provider**, sourced from each adapter's
  `model-meta.ts` (newest `gpt-*`, `claude-*`, `gemini-*`, …), in example code.
- **Maintain `addedAt` / `updatedAt` on docs entries in `docs/config.json`.**
  Every page entry carries an `addedAt` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) and, once edited, an
  `updatedAt`. When you touch a docs page, update its entry: add a new entry
  with `addedAt` set to today's date for a **new page**, or set/refresh
  `updatedAt` to today's date when you make a **content change** to an existing
  page (new section, capability, reworked guidance, new examples). **Bug fixes
  don't bump anything** — typos, broken links, code-fence languages,
  formatting, and factual fixes must not touch `addedAt` or `updatedAt`.
- Run `pnpm test:docs` (link verification) before pushing.

## Everything Else

For package manager (`pnpm@10.17.0`), monorepo layout, adapter architecture,
tool system, framework integrations, E2E requirements, and all other
conventions, read `CLAUDE.md` in this directory.
